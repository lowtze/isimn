This is a Markdown conversion of the scanned PDF of "Italiano Secondo il Metodo Natura" published in 1962 by the Nature Method Centre accessible [here](https://csclub.uwaterloo.ca/~rfburger/language/L%27italiano%20secondo%20il%20metodo%20natura/L%27italiano%20secondo%20il%20metodo%20natura.pdf).

I am learning Italian via this method and transcribing as I go along with plans to eventually produce an EPUB through Pandoc, which will include all illustrations and sidenotes from the book.
